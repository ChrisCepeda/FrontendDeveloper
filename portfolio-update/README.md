            <p> I'm currently doing my internship as a Frontend Developer 
              at <a href="https://lemontree.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Lemontree</a>, a swedish IT-company creating digital transformation and 
              increase quality in companies systems and services.<br></br></p>
             
             <p> In March 2023 I will receive my Diploma in Frontend Development from Hyper Island.
              HI learning methods have been to integrate with the industry at once through projects in teams led by 
              professionals. The diversity and the experimental way of learning has really made me developed great soft skills.

              <h3>DESIGN</h3>
              <p> I used to travel the world, seeing so much potential in the textile industry. So for severl years I had my own
              business, collaborting with local tailors in India and Bali with pattern construction and designing cloth collections. 
              This was a great opportunity and experience to explore materials, pattern design and sewing techniques.
              Also managing retail, customer service and import and export; coordinating with shipping agents for exporting and importing goods.
